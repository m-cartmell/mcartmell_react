  "text": [
    "Status Seating manufactures a variety of chairs in a number of different configurations. They required a brochure to not only highlight but also compare the features and options of their product range.",
    "The main issue was creating a set of feature images on a modest budget. Image-comping the chairs into suitable backgrounds was the most viable solution; the upholstery was hand-picked to complement the surroundings.",
    "The brochure's clean layout and subtle design features improve readability and usability, while generously sized product shots help support the information. Plenty of white space allows the pages to breathe."
